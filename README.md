# matlab-simulation
Matlab simulation scripts for my ultrasonic phased array.
The libraries used in this simulation are created by Lester W Schmerr Jr, a reference how to used them as well as a explanation of the physics this model is based on can be found in the books "Fundamentals of Ultrasonic Nondestructive Evaluation" and "Fundamentals of Ultrasonic Phased Arrays", both written by Lester W Schmerr Jr.

# Simulation output
An example can be found in "output", a video showing beam steering of a phased array as used in this project. In the future this simulation might be ported to a more efficient language like numpy or C/C++ to calculate real time beam patterns.
